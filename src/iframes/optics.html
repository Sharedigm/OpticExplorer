	<h1>History of the Double Gauss</h1>
	<p>The double Gauss lens consists of two back-to-back Gauss lenses (a design with a positive meniscus lens on the object side and a negative meniscus lens on the image side) making two positive meniscus lenses on the outside with two negative meniscus lenses inside them. The symmetry of the system and the splitting of the optical power into many elements reduces the optical aberrations within the system. There are many variations of the design. Sometimes extra lens elements are added. The basic lens type is one of the most developed and used photographic lenses. The design forms the basis for many camera lenses in use today, especially the wide-aperture standard lenses used on 35 mm and other small-format cameras. It can offer good results up to f/1.4 with a wide field of view, and has sometimes been made at f/1.0. Extra wide aperture f/1.4 Double Gauss lenses usually have seven elements for extra aberration control. Modern super wide aperture models can have eight or more elements. Moderate aperture f/2.8 versions can be simplified to five elements.</p>

	<p>The Double Gauss was likely the most intensively studied lens formula of the twentieth century,[1] producing dozens of major variants, scores of minor variants, hundreds of marketed lenses and tens of millions of unit sales.[2][3] It had almost no flaws, except for a bit of oblique spherical aberration, which could lower peripheral contrast.[4] Double Gauss/Planar tweaks were the standard wide aperture, normal and near-normal prime lens for sixty years.</p>

	<p>The original two element Gauss was a telescope objective lens consisting of closely spaced positive and negative menisci, invented in 1817 by Carl Friedrich Gauss as an improvement to the Fraunhofer Achromatic telescope objective lens by adding a meniscus lens to its single convex and concave lens design.[5] Alvan Clark and Bausch & Lomb further refined the design in 1888 by taking two of these lenses and placing them back to back making a "double Gauss"[6] with indifferent photographic results.[7] Current double Gauss lenses can be traced back to an 1895 improved design, when Paul Rudolph of Carl Zeiss Jena thickened the interior negative menisci and converted to them to cemented doublets of two elements of equal refraction but differing dispersion in the Zeiss Planar of 1896[8] to correct for chromatic aberration. It was the original six element symmetric f/4.5 Double Gauss lens.[9] Horace William Lee added a slight asymmetry to the Planar in 1920, and created the Taylor, Taylor & Hobson Series 0 (also called the Lee Opic, UK) f/2 lens.[10] It was commercially unsuccessful, but its asymmetry is the foundation of the modern Double Gauss, including the Zeiss Biotar.[11] Later the design was developed with additional glasses to give high-performance lenses of wide aperture. The main development was due to Taylor Hobson in the 1920s, resulting in the f/2.0 Opic and later the Speed Panchro designs, which were licensed to various other manufacturers. In 1927, Lee modified the Opic design and increase the maximum aperture up to f/1.4, that is the Ultra Panchro lens. Further improvement was done by Lee in 1930, the Super Speed Panchro.[12] It was a f/1.5 fast design with 7 glasses in 5 groups, which soon became new popular of fast speed lens type and was cited by many lens manufacturers until the 1960s.</p>
