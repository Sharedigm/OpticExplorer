	<h2>BK-7</h2>
	<p>BK-7 (as well as the very similar K9) refers to a type of borosilicate glass that has long been and still is widely used across many different optical product brands and models. BK-7 and K9 are lower in cost than BaK-4 and therefore are often found in lower priced products than BaK-4.</p>

	<h2>BAK4</h2>
	<p>BaK4 refers to a light barium crown glass that, as it is much more expensive than BK-7 or K9 glass, is generally found in mid- to high-end price ranges optical instruments. For binoculars, spotting scopes, and monoculars, BaK-4 is generally preferable to BK-7 or K9 as it has a higher refractive index and, when used in a well-designed overall optical system, provides higher levels of image quality than would a prism assembly of the same type made with BK-7 or K9 glass.</p>
